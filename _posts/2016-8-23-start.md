title: Grand Opening of Awesome Pizza
---

Though we’ve already been serving some great pizzas, leni d’s is so excited to host our official grand opening on August, 23!  Stop by our location on Garland Groh Blvd. – next to Starbucks and FedEx Kinkos – and build your own pizza.

Many people have asked “How is leni d’s different from other pizza places?”  The answer is high quality, wicked good pizza – fast.

Choose your dough – traditional, whole wheat, or gluten free.
Select from our variety of sauces, including olive oil infused options.
Top your pizza with any of our two dozen toppings – cheeses, meats, fruits, and veggies.
We’ll pop it in the oven and you’ll enjoy your personalized pizza in less than three minutes.
Our grand opening will feature specials, giveaways, and more.  Stop by leni d’s for lunch or dinner (or both) on August 23 and get “za fast.”
