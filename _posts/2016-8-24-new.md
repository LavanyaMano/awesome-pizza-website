title: New Pizza Flavor

Here is the new flavor.
 Its Zucchini Pizza!!

 I love good summer zucchini, but let's face it: It's not the most exciting vegetable in the world. In fact, it's one of the blandest. That's why, whether I'm sautéeing it or grilling it, I always try to hit it with as much heat as possible. There's just no other way to give it a nice, browned flavor before it has a chance to over-soften and turn into mush.

It's for this reason that zucchini makes a terrible pizza topping.

But wait a minute! I can hear you say. Doesn't a pizza oven get really, really hot, which is exactly what you want for zucchini?

Well, yes, it does, but the problem is that pizza ovens cook primarily by convection of hot air, and air is not a particularly efficient means of heat transfer. Even in a 900°F pizza oven, you won't get any browning at all on a slice of zucchini by the time the pizza crust has finished cooking. Every zucchini-topped pizza I've had in the past has been a watery disappointment. If there's one thing I love, it's being not-disappointed. So I made it my goal to come up with a technique for topping pizza with zucchini that really works.
